Exp 4 (a): Experimental determination of the frequency response of Series Resonant RLC Circuits

Aim:-
Experimental verification of frequency response of R-L-C series Circuit

Procedure:-
1. Connect the circuit elements as mentioned below 1-3 ,4-5 ,8-6, 6-10, 9-11, 2-7, 7-9(ex:-Drag from 1 and click on 3.). Click on 'Check' button. If the alert message shows wrong connection, click on 'Delete' button.
2. 3 volt p-p sinusoidal voltage is applied at the input.Put R=200Ω initially ,L=0.1H, C=0.1uF.
3. Switch on the oscilloscope by clicking "ON" button & click twice the Sine wave button for input signal & click on the"Output" button to observe the output.Channel & Channel2 button shows the input & output signals respectively. Dual, shows both of them.
4. Change the Frequency of input signal by the Frequency knob from 100Hz to 5KHz or 5000Hz & observe the corresponding output voltage signal.
5. If in any case the output signal waveform exceeds the graphical grid or the oscilloscope area,increase the value of volt/div through volt/div knob both for input and output signals. for Ex. for 1500Hz it may be observed. Then increase the volt/div values to approximate 2 using those two volt/div knobs. Again if in any case the input signal comes as a straight line, decrease the Time/div value to 0.2 using Time/div knob at the bottom.
6. Switch off the oscilloscope
7. Click on Tableshow button each time after clicking on "output" button to see observation each time.
8. Click on 'GainPlot' button to see the frequency response plot(Gain(dB)vs.Frequency(Hz))& click on the 'Phaseplot'button to see the corresponding phase response.Click on Clear button to clear datas.
9. Switch off the oscilloscope. Increase 'R' value through the rheostat (hover the mouse pointer over the green vertical rectangle, its color will change to a darker green. Then drag it to the right.) to increase the value of ζ and observe different results for damping ratio ζ = (0.1,0.2,0.3,0.5,0.7).
10. From the Gain plots the maximum gain,-3dB frequency can be observed for different ζ .
